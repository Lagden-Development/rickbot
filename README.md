## Introduction

RickBot is designed to help developers build scalable and maintainable Discord bots with ease. Using the discord.py library, RickBot provides a structured and modular approach to bot development, making it simple to extend functionality as your bot grows.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily add or remove features through cogs.
- **Database Integration:** MongoDB is supported for robust and flexible data storage.
- **Highly Configurable:** Extensive options for fine-tuning bot behavior.
- **Extensible:** Quickly add custom commands and events.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

- **Python 3.10+**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip**: Python package installer (typically included with Python)
- **git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- **MongoDB**: [MongoDB Setup Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/) | [Free MongoDB Deployment](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zachlagden/rickbot
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd rickbot
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### Config Files Overview

- `config.json`: Holds the core bot configuration.
- `customconfig.json`: Optional file for additional custom settings.

> **Note:** `config.py` is not a configuration file itself. It ensures that `config.json` and `customconfig.json` are properly loaded into the project.

### Example `config.json`

```json
{
  "mode": "dev",
  "devs": [123456789],
  "bot": {
    "token": "BOT TOKEN",
    "prefix": "!",
    "status": {
      "type": "playing",
      "message": "a game"
    }
  },
  "behaviour": {
    "continue_to_load_cogs_after_failure": false
  },
  "mongo": {
    "uri": "mongodb uri",
    "bot_specific_db": "bot"
  }
}
```

## Project Structure

- **`app.py`**: Main entry point for running the bot.
- **`cogs/`**: Directory for bot functionality modules (cogs).
- **`helpers/`**: Utility functions and helper scripts.
- **`rickbot/`**: Core framework files for RickBot.
- **`config.json`**: Primary configuration file.
- **`customconfig.json`**: Optional file for additional custom settings.

## Usage

To start the bot, run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Creating Custom Cogs

Cogs are modular extensions used to add functionality to your bot. They should be placed in the `cogs/<category>/` directory, where additional folders separate cog categories. To maintain optimal organization, RickBot encourages using one cog per command.

### Example Cog

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

class ExampleCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot

    @commands.command()
    async def hello(self, ctx):
        await ctx.send("Hello, world!")

def setup(bot):
    bot.add_cog(ExampleCog(bot))
```

## Database Integration

RickBot integrates with MongoDB for data storage. Ensure your MongoDB URI is correctly set in the `config.json` file. The `db.py` file serves as a convenient base for managing database connections and collections, but feel free to customize it to meet your specific requirements.

### Example MongoDB Usage

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from config import CONFIG

client = MongoClient(CONFIG['mongo']['uri'])
db = client['rickbot']
collection = db['example']
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Installation Issues:** Ensure all prerequisites are correctly installed, and verify your environment variables.
- **Bot Not Responding:** Confirm that the bot token is valid and the bot has appropriate permissions.
- **Database Errors:** Verify your MongoDB URI and ensure that MongoDB is running.
