# This file typically serves as the initialization file for the rickbot package.
# It can be used to initialize package-level variables or import certain
# functionalities when the package is imported elsewhere in the application.
# However, in this case, we are simply providing documentation to clarify the
# purpose of the package.

# Since no code is required to be executed at the package level, this file is left empty.
# All the essential functionality should be defined and run through app.py.
